# > Formatting conventions for your app.
#
# This file (`.editorconfig`) exists to help
# maintain consistent formatting throughout the
# files in your app.
#
# These defaults have proven to be effective
# though many teams / years / projects. 4 spaces
# is much easier to see block separations than
# with just 2 (as is the Sails default).
#
# To review what each of these options mean, see:
# http://editorconfig.org/
